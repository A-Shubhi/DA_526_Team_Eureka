Image-to-image translation is a fundamental computer vision problem with applications in artistic style transfer, photo enhancement, and domain adaptation.
However, many existing models are highly specialized and complex to implement.

In this project , we explore multiple approaches to image-to-image translation using both Deep learning-based models and Traditional image filtering techniques. 

We explored Aerial to map (covered by Shivam ), selfie to anime (covered by Ankita) , image transaltion using non deep techniques (covered by Shubhi) , image to oil painitng using deep learning (by Sunanda) and real to ghibili using deep learning (by Lakshya). 

The demo video for various approaches are:
